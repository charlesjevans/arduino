In the Beginning:
Arduinos are most fun when you can build ideas quickly.
Quick builds result from having code examples you saved from prior projects.
Focus on completing many small projects first and saving the code examples. 
Complex projects are made by combining these basic functions.
Setup a GitHub account and document your projects early on.

Avoid Premature Optimization:
The first priority is to see if an idea will work at all.
Once it works then it is much easier to improve incrementally.
Optimizing a project before building it can squash progress.
