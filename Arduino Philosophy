In the Beginning:
Arduinos are most fun when you can build ideas quickly.
Quick builds result from having code examples you saved from prior projects.
At first, focus on completing many small projects. Save the code examples. 
Complex projects are made by combining basic examples from your collection of code.
Setup a GitHub account and document your projects early on.

Avoid Premature Optimization:
The first priority is to see if an idea will work at all.
Once it works then it is much easier to improve incrementally.
Optimizing a project before building it can squash progress. 

Productivity results from creative use of existing resources.
Buying more parts and tools does not equal greater productivity.

Buying 10 parts for 20$ is not 'cheaper' if you only need one part.

Find authoritative sources of information and stick to them.
Avoid fishing around for random tutorials. They often contain errors.

If you have an idea for a project first search YouTube.
Learn from the experiences of others before buying parts.

Buying the cheapest part usually means there is no quality control.
Use online retailers with good customer service even if parts cost a little more.

Project Complexity:
Know your limitations in terms of time, money, and skills.
Complexity tends to increases exponentially.
